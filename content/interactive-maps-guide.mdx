# How to Add Interactive Maps to Your Personal Website

Static lists of places you've been can be dull. Interactive maps, on the other hand, offer a dynamic and visually engaging way to tell your story. On my personal website, I've included two distinct maps: a world map to showcase the countries I've visited, and a detailed map of Hong Kong highlighting my favorite local spots.

This guide will walk you through the technical implementation of both maps, providing a step-by-step tutorial for you to integrate similar features into your own projects.

## Part 1: The World Map with react-simple-maps

For a clean, stylized, and lightweight world map, react-simple-maps is an excellent choice. It's a React library that makes it easy to create projections, add interactivity, and customize your map's appearance.

The implementation for this map can be found in `src/components/world-map.tsx`.

### Step 1: Get Your Map Data and Set Up the Component

First, you'll need geographic data for the world's countries, typically in TopoJSON or GeoJSON format. You can find files like `world-countries.json` online. Once you have your data, you can set up the main map component.

The `ComposableMap` component acts as a container for your map. Inside, the `Geographies` component fetches and parses your JSON data.

```javascript
// src/components/world-map.tsx
import { ComposableMap, Geographies, Geography } from "react-simple-maps";
import geoData from "../../public/world-countries.json"; // Your map data

const WorldMap = () => (
  <ComposableMap
    projection="geoMercator"
    projectionConfig={% raw %}{{
      scale: 150, // Adjust the scale to zoom in/out
    }}{% endraw %}
  >
    <Geographies geography={geoData}>
      {({ geographies }) =>
        geographies.map((geo) => (
          <Geography key={geo.rsmKey} geography={geo} />
        ))
      }
    </Geographies>
  </ComposableMap>
);
```

### Step 2: Highlight Visited Countries

To make the map your own, you can highlight the countries you've visited. Create an array of the countries' ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 codes and use it to conditionally style each `Geography` component.

```javascript
// src/components/world-map.tsx

const visitedCountries = [
  "USA", "CHN", "JPN", "FRA", // and so on...
];

// Inside the component...
const isVisited = visitedCountries.includes(geo.id);

return (
  <Geography
    key={geo.rsmKey}
    geography={geo}
    style={% raw %}{{
      default: {
        fill: isVisited ? "#5AC8FA" : "#E5E7EB", // Visited color vs. default
        outline: "none",
      },
      hover: {
        fill: "#007AFF", // Hover color
        outline: "none",
      },
    }}{% endraw %}
  />
);
```

This code checks if a country's ID (its ISO code) is present in the `visitedCountries` array and applies a different fill color if it is.

### Step 3: Add Interactivity with Tooltips

A simple tooltip that shows the country's name on hover adds a great layer of interactivity. This can be managed with a React state hook.

```javascript
// src/components/world-map.tsx
const [hoveredCountry, setHoveredCountry] = useState<string | null>(null);

//...
<Geography
  //...
  onMouseEnter={() => setHoveredCountry(geo.properties.name)}
  onMouseLeave={() => setHoveredCountry(null)}
/>

//... and render the tooltip conditionally
{hoveredCountry && (
  <div className="absolute top-2 left-1/2 transform -translate-x-1/2 bg-white p-2 rounded shadow">
    {hoveredCountry}
  </div>
)}
```

The `onMouseEnter` and `onMouseLeave` events update the state, which in turn shows or hides the tooltip.

## Part 2: A Detailed Local Map with react-leaflet

When you need a more detailed, zoomable map with custom markers, react-leaflet is the perfect tool. It provides a React wrapper around the popular Leaflet.js library.

The implementation for this map is in `src/components/hong-kong-map.tsx`.

### Step 1: Set Up the Leaflet Map Container

The `MapContainer` component from react-leaflet creates the map. You'll also need a `TileLayer`, which fetches map tiles from a service like OpenStreetMap.

```javascript
// src/components/hong-kong-map.tsx
import { MapContainer, TileLayer, Marker, Popup } from "react-leaflet";
import "leaflet/dist/leaflet.css"; // Don't forget to import the CSS

const HongKongMap = () => (
  <MapContainer center={[22.35, 114.15]} zoom={10} style={% raw %}{{ height: '400px', width: '100%' }}{% endraw %}>
    <TileLayer
      url="https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png"
      attribution='&copy; OpenStreetMap contributors'
    />
    {/* Markers will be rendered here */}
  </MapContainer>
);
```

### Step 2: Define Custom Markers and Locations

To highlight specific spots, you'll need their coordinates. You can store this data in an object. For a more personalized touch, you can create custom icons for your markers.

```javascript
// src/components/hong-kong-map.tsx
import L from "leaflet";

// Define custom icons
const natureIcon = new L.Icon({
  iconUrl: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pointhi/leaflet-color-markers/master/img/marker-icon-2x-green.png',
  iconSize: [25, 41],
  iconAnchor: [12, 41],
});

// Define your locations
const locations = {
  "Tai Mo Shan": {
    name: "Tai Mo Shan (大帽山)",
    coordinates: [22.4197, 114.1175],
    type: "nature"
  },
  // ... more locations
};
```

### Step 3: Render Markers and Popups

Finally, map over your locations data to render a `Marker` for each spot. Use the `icon` prop to apply your custom icons and add a `Popup` to display more information when a marker is clicked.

```javascript
// Inside the MapContainer
{Object.entries(locations).map(([key, location]) => (
  <Marker
    key={key}
    position={location.coordinates as [number, number]}
    icon={location.type === 'nature' ? natureIcon : urbanIcon}
  >
    <Popup>
      <span className="font-semibold">{location.name}</span>
      <br />
      {location.description}
    </Popup>
  </Marker>
))}
```

This will place a marker for each location on the map, complete with a custom icon and a popup that reveals more details on click.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you can create beautiful and informative maps that add a personal and professional touch to your website. The combination of react-simple-maps for global visualization and react-leaflet for detailed local exploration provides a comprehensive mapping solution that can showcase your travels and experiences in an engaging way.

The key benefits of this approach include:
- **Visual storytelling**: Maps provide an immediate visual impact that text alone cannot achieve
- **Interactive engagement**: Users can explore your experiences through hover effects and clickable markers
- **Responsive design**: Both libraries work well across different screen sizes
- **Customization**: You can tailor colors, icons, and interactions to match your website's design
- **Performance**: Lightweight libraries ensure fast loading times

Whether you're showcasing your global travels or highlighting local favorites, interactive maps can transform your personal website into a more engaging and memorable experience for your visitors.
