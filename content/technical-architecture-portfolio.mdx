This post outlines the technical architecture and design decisions behind my personal portfolio website. The project started after I saw a Reddit comment suggesting, "For a startup, get a landing page with Magic UI."

While researching that for my own startup, I came across dillionverma/portfolio. I liked the clean, Apple-inspired design and precise UI interactions, so I decided to adapt it first as my personal site. Over time, it evolved into a technical playground to showcase my experiments, projects, and ideas.

## 1. Core Technology Stack & Configuration

The stack was chosen to balance performance, scalability, and long-term maintainability.

**Framework**: The portfolio is built with Next.js 14, using the new App Router for file-based routing and built-in server-side rendering capabilities. I configured `next.config.mjs` with `output: 'export'` to generate a fully static export, making it easy to host on GitHub Pages.

**Language**: TypeScript is used throughout, providing strict type safety and reducing runtime errors. The `tsconfig.json` enforces strict mode and defines path aliases (e.g., `@/*`) to simplify and clarify imports.

**Styling**: Tailwind CSS is the primary styling framework, with custom configurations defined in `tailwind.config.ts`. The setup integrates `tailwindcss-animate` for fine-tuned keyframe animations and supports both light and dark modes via a ThemeProvider.

**UI Components**: The UI layer combines shadcn/ui and Magic UI. Unlike external black-box libraries, these components live directly in `src/components/ui/`, making them fully customizable.

**3D Graphics & Animations**: Three.js, rendered via React Three Fiber, is used for interactive 3D visualizations. Helper components from `@react-three/drei` simplify common tasks such as camera controls and geometry setup. Framer Motion powers animations throughout the UI, from dock hover interactions to scroll-triggered reveals.

**Deployment**: Automated deployment is set up using GitHub Actions. Each push triggers a build (via pnpm), generates the static site, and deploys directly to GitHub Pages, providing a predictable and reproducible release process.

## 2. Component Architecture

The frontend is designed around modular, reusable components, with a strong emphasis on composability and clarity.

### Navigation and Dock

**Navbar & Dock** (`src/components/navbar.tsx`, `src/components/magicui/dock.tsx`):
The main navigation includes a macOS-style dock that scales icons dynamically based on cursor proximity, implemented with framer-motion. The Navbar also includes a dark/light mode toggle and a button to activate an Aquarium overlay for additional visual detail.

### Cards

**ResumeCard & ProjectCard** (`src/components/resume-card.tsx`, `src/components/project-card.tsx`):
Cards are used extensively across "Work," "Education," and "Projects" sections. These components can expand and collapse with animated transitions, and support dynamic content like tech stacks, video previews, and links.

### Table of Contents

**Table of Contents** (`src/components/table-of-contents.tsx`):
A floating, scroll-synced navigation element uses IntersectionObserver to track which page section is currently in view. This improves user orientation and overall navigation on longer pages.

### Interactive Visualizations

**Rubik's Cube** (`src/components/rubiks-cube.tsx`):
A fully animated 3D Rubik's Cube built with React Three Fiber. The solver class implements the CFOP method and executes each stage in real time using `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth, incremental rotations.

**Maps** (`src/components/world-map.tsx`, `src/components/hong-kong-map.tsx`):
The world map uses react-simple-maps and d3-geo to highlight visited countries. The Hong Kong map uses react-leaflet with categorized custom markers to show local points of interest.

**GitHub Contributions** (`src/components/github-contributions.tsx`):
Fetches contribution data from GitHub's GraphQL API and renders it as a heatmap, similar to the official GitHub profile view. Includes responsive layout and loading states for smooth performance.

### Showcase Visualizations

**Protein Folding** (`src/components/protein-folding.tsx`):
Visualizes the folding of a polypeptide backbone using TubeGeometry, with color coding based on predicted confidence (inspired by pLDDT). Includes a 2D PAE plot rendered on `<canvas>`, providing additional structural uncertainty insight.

**Torus-Mug Morph** (`src/components/torus-mug-morph.tsx`):
A demonstration of topological equivalence between a torus and a coffee mug. Vertex positions and normals are interpolated using custom `lerpArray` and `lerpColor` utilities, allowing real-time shape morphing controlled by a slider.

### UI Effects and Additional Features

**BlurFade Components** (`src/components/magicui/blur-fade.tsx`, `src/components/magicui/blur-fade-text.tsx`):
Implements staggered fade-in animations for text and UI elements as they scroll into view, using framer-motion hooks.

**Aquarium Overlay** (`src/components/aquarium.tsx`):
A toggleable, animated overlay with fish and shrimp that move dynamically across the screen. Motion is handled via `requestAnimationFrame`, with boundary collision logic to simulate natural movement.

### Commonplace Book

The "Commonplace Book" section functions as a living record of books and essays that influence my thinking. Rather than simply listing titles, it serves as a curated, transparent window into what shapes my ideas and approaches.

## 3. Conclusion

This portfolio is designed as both a personal website and a technical sandbox by combining Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Magic UI, and advanced visualization libraries like React Three Fiber.
